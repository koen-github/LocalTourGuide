# LocalTourGuide

This is the source code of an android application called 'Local Tour Guide'. 
Local Tour Guide is an application where users can add tours and information for other users.
So they can create a tour for users to follow, add waypoints and extend these with Images, Text, Audio or Video's.

It main focus is on personal stories of users instead of the familiar touristic places.

# Information for Developers

The Local Tour Guide application is developed with extendibility in mind. This means it's really easy to add additional features.
I used Android Studio with Graddle as build system. The only problems I can think of when trying to compile my application is the version differences.
